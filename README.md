### Project is done using Django, Python, HTML5, Bootstrap and CSS.

### Project theme and description: 

The project is based on the game World of Warcraft. It is a combination of an Armory (place where players can register and see their characters) and a wiki (articles can be created for characters of the World of Warcraft Lore). Users of the Website, can choose their character name, faction, race, class, level, etc. and they can visualize their profiles.

Additionally, the Website provides a Poll system, since World of Warcraft is a team-based game, and many decisions are usually made by voting.
